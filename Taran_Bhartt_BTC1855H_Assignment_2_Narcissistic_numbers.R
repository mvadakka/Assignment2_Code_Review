#' 1. Prompt the user to enter a three digit positive number
#' Plan: 
#'       Prompt the user to input a 3 digit positive number using the readline function
UserNumber <- readline(prompt = "Input a three digit number: ")

#' 2. Check if the user input is numeric. If not, print an error message and quit.
#' Plan: 
#'       Check if the user actually input a 3 digit positive number
#'       if T
#'          Convert the user input into a numeric value
#'       else
#'          Write an error message

} # #MV COMMENT: You could probably combine lines 17 and 20 as both the else conditions aim to trigger an error message, followed by the retry print message  

#' 3. Check if the number is narcissistic. A narcissistic number, or an Armstrong
#'    number, is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its own digits. 
#'    153, 370, 371, 407 are three digit Armstrong numbers.
#' plan: 
#'      Break up the number, which must originally be left as a string #MV COMMENT: explain why must it be originally left as a string, so when you look back at the code you can easily remember why
#'      Check if the number is an Armstrong number

#' 4. Display the result with an appropriate message, e.g. 
#'    “127 is not an Armstrong number” or “370 is a narcissistic number” 
#'    or any additional fun text you may want to add.
#' plan: 
#'      Use the print and paste function to display the message
#'      Include a function to restart the program or press a key to escape

#' The following code checks if the number is narcissistic (#3) and then displays the result
Fragment <- as.numeric(strsplit(UserNumber,"")[[1]]) #MV COMMENT: What does the "[[1]]" refer to? perhaps explain so its more clear!
if (UserNumber == sum(Fragment^3)){
  print(paste(UserNumber,"is an Armstrong Number"))
}else{
  print(paste(UserNumber,"is not an Armstrong Number"))}

#MV COMMENT: Overall, great job - efficient use of commands and easy to understand :) 
# A few comments added above (Lines 22, 28, 39) on explaining a little bit more of the nitty
# gritty details so when you look back it's easy to understand
